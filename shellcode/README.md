# Using C to build OSX Shellcode 

A small setup that I used to learn X86_x64 shellcode generation using ASM and compiled C code. 


## OSX Setup

Please ensure you have the following installed before starting to build.

- Install XCode: `xcode-select --install`
- Install Brew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- Install Brew GCC: `brew install gcc`
